a couple weeks into learning Rust; here are some of my takeaways so far:

love the type system. that's definitely been huge for me in Elm, and it's nice to see a familiar version of it here. still have some learning to do re: the trait system, but seems like Rust gives you what you need to model your data accurately

the compiler seems good in terms of catching type errors, unused variables, incomplete match statements, etc. these are all helpful aspects of the Elm compiler too. Rust doesn't have its friendly style, but seems to hit the important parts

the parts i have to get used to are the concepts of mutability and data ownership, leading to copy types vs. reference types. my first impression is that i just want to avoid them entirely, and write Rust in a pure-functional style where all references are immutable.

so i am curious when mutable data is most useful, and how possible it is to avoid it when writing idiomatically and using other libraries from the ecosystem.
