day 6 of #100DaysOfCode learning Rust:
today i learned about passing mutable and immutable references to functions

coming from mainly writing Elm for the past 5 years or so,  where all data is immutable, i'm not at all used to mutable data and the ownership of data being a question. makes me wonder whether i'll approach writing Rust in an fp style or be swayed by the upsides of mutability
