I'm excited to announce the initial release of elm-music-theory, a new music theory package for [Elm](https://twitter.com/elmlang)! Read about it here: [https://dmalashock.com/elm-music-theory-v1-0-0/](https://dmalashock.com/elm-music-theory-v1-0-0/)

Here is an interactive demo that voices chords in four parts using elm-music-theory. Explore chords and voicing methods, and see and hear the results: [https://duncanmalashock.github.io/elm-music-theory-examples/chord-voicings/](https://duncanmalashock.github.io/elm-music-theory-examples/chord-voicings/)
